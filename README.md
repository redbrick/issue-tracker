# issue-tracker

Central repository for all Kanban project issues.

This is not used for any code. It is used to allow comments on issues that are tracked via the [aperture](https://github.com/orgs/redbrick/projects/1) project and the [old hardware](https://github.com/orgs/redbrick/projects/2) project.
